Campussion
Question Answer Platform For college students in a campus


# What inspired us to this project?

College are the hubspots of doubts and commotion. We are overwhelmed with questions and curiosity and are inundated with pertaining doubts. What generally happens, is that we resort to Google to act as our saviour for various college-related doubts. While Google does provide a generic answer to all our questions, we miss highly on point the specific doubts of a campus. This hassle to get our queries answered in specific-reference to our college inspired us to create Campussion.

# Our Solution

We gave ideation to a question-answer Quora like platform Campussion for a specific college campus. Herein you can login with your name and roll no. and post your doubt, while the other studets in your campus can answer. There are categories that you can associate with your doubt which makes them easily visible. We have categories like academics, clubs, hostels etc. Now you have the option to get your doubts clarified with a specific audience

#Tech Stack used

We have implemented the web application using CSS, Javascript,PHP and MYSQL. 

#Challenges Faced

Since this was our first hackathon with no prior good experience in the backend, we faced challenges to well integrate forms with database. Additionally, we faced challenge in implementing a search question bar that would search the questions of a relevant category. We had to spend a lot of time in brainstorming ideas.
